This directory contains the main documentation for RPy.  It is in texinfo
format in the file 'rpy.texi'.  Several formats derived from this file are
provided.  If you need another format, please, ask me.

Formats provided:

rpy.dvi
rpy.info
rpy.pdf
rpy.html [directory]


If you need to rebuild the documentation, you can do:

    make dvi         (to build the dvi file)
    make pdf	     (to build the pdf file)
    make html	     (to build the directory 'manual_html')
    make info	     (to build the info file)

    make all	     (to build all the formats)
    make clean       (to remove auxiliary files)
    make dist-clean  (to remove all formats)

You must have the correspondig tools to build the different formats, see the
Makefile.
